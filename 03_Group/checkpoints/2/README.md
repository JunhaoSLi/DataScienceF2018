# Questions

These are the questions we decided to look into for this checkpoint:

1. When considering officers involved in cases that resulted in settlements, is there a correlation between the amount that the officer cost the city of Chicago and the number of complaints levied against the officer?

2. Does the correlation between cost to city and complaints levied change when considering race and gender of officer? Do officers with the same number of complaints levied against them have to pay different amounts when considering race and gender?

3. Is there a correlation between the groups of complainants that make the most allegations and the groups of individuals that are arrested the most by beat?

4. Is there a correlation between number of allegations received before an officerâ€™s first settlement case and number of allegations received after?

# Procedure

Three custom tables were made for these questions, `complaints_per_cop`, `total_cost_per_officer`, and `min_settlement_dates`.

`complaints_per_cop` was made with the following query within the CPDB:

```
SELECT officer_id, COUNT(*) AS num_complaints
FROM data_officer 
JOIN data_officerallegation ON data_officer.id = data_officerallegation.officer_id
GROUP BY officer_id
ORDER BY officer_id
```

`total_cost_per_officer` was made using the following steps in Trifacta (all tables from this point are named as they appear in the CPDB and settlement database except for officer_map which was the linking table between the CPB and settlement database provided by Professor Rogers):
1. Join `cops_cop` with  `cops_casecop` on `id` and `cop_id`, respectively.
2. Join with `cases_payment` on `case_id` and `case_id`.
3. Join with `officer_map` on `cop_id` and `settlement_cop_id`.
4. Join with `data_officer` on `cpdb_id` and `id`.
5. Compute a pivot table with `data_officer.id`, `data_officer.race`, `data_officer.gender` as columns for `SUM(payment) + SUM(fees_costs)`.

`min_settlement_dates` was made with same procedure as `total_cost_per_officer` except by (1) replacing the join in step 2 with
a join with `cases_case` and (2) replacing the pivot table columns in step 5 with just `data_officer.id` and replacing the formula with `MIN(cases_case.date_closed)`.

## Queries

With the tables above and the CPDB, the following queries were used to answer our questions.

Question 1:

```
REGULAR QUERY

\copy (SELECT num_complaints, total_cost FROM total_cost_per_officer, complaints_per_cop WHERE total_cost_per_officer.officer_id=complaints_per_cop.officer_id) to 'complaints_and_cost.csv' with csv;

AGGREGATE QUERY

\copy (SELECT num_complaints, AVG(total_cost) FROM total_cost_per_officer, complaints_per_cop WHERE total_cost_per_officer.officer_id=complaints_per_cop.officer_id GROUP BY complaints_per_cop.num_complaints ORDER BY complaints_per_cop.num_complaints) to 'aggregate_complaints_and_cost.csv' with csv;
```

Question 2:

```
QUERY FOR RACES / GENDERS (AGGREGATE)

\copy (SELECT num_complaints, AVG(total_cost), race, gender FROM total_cost_per_officer, complaints_per_cop, data_officer WHERE data_officer.id=total_cost_per_officer.officer_id AND total_cost_per_officer.officer_id=complaints_per_cop.officer_id GROUP BY data_officer.race, data_officer.gender, complaints_per_cop.num_complaints ORDER BY data_officer.race, data_officer.gender, num_complaints) to 'aggregate_complaints_and_cost_by_race_and_gender.csv' with csv;

Question 3:
