The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up.

It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization. Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer.",0

It was generally alleged against all of the members that they entered a first floor front apartment without justification and a first floor rear apartment without justification. It was further alleged against the accused lieutenant that he failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant. Against the accused sergeant, it was alleged that he failed to ensure proper execution of a search warrant and that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report submitted to IPRA. Lastly, against one of the principally accused officers, it was alleged that he kicked an occupant of one of the residences in his ribs. Nine of the accused members were EXONERATED of the first general allegation that the members entered the first floor front residence without justification, based on the determination that it was entered during the execution of a valid search warrant. The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units. The second general allegation against the accused sergeant and one of the accused officers, that they entered the first floor rear apartment improperly was NOT SUSTAINED because although they were identified by the complainant, no other evidence could support the allegation that they entered the first floor rear apartment without justification. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.",0

In addition, the victim further alleged that on separate occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer. There were conflicting statements between the accused and the victim, and there were no independent witnesses to corroborate either account, therefore IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused member threatened to kill the victim.

Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN an additional allegation that the accused officer provided a false report in that he denied having knowledge that the victim was a convicted felon and denied accessing her criminal history. Because there were no records of 911 calls reporting domestic disturbances at the subject location on the dates alleged by the victim, and because various witnesses disclosed by the victim did not cooperate with IPRAs investigation and could not corroborate the allegations that on several occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations.
