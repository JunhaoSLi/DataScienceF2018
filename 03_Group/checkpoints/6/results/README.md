# Visualization 1: 

## 1. The types of officers (based on race, gender, and salary) that have complaints placed against them in different areas of Chicago and to what extent does median income in areas match up to this.

#### Conclusions: 
In our maps showing the proportions of allegations involving officers of a particular race by beat, the maps with the most notable disparity between areas of Chicago are those for white, black, and hispanic officers. The majority of allegation counts are against white officers for most beats but an area of beats in South Chicago near the shore appear to be an exception. Allegation counts involving black officers are shown to make up a higher proportion of all allegation counts in parts of South Chicago but never in North Chicago. There is a rise in the proportion of allegation counts for Hispanic officers in a specific region that seem to correspond to South Lawndale and the Lower West Side which both have high hispanic populations. Asian/Pacific and Native American officer allegation counts are sparse across all beats.

The maps for proportions of allegation counts against officers of a gender have little disparity. Female officers seem to make up a lesser proportion of allegation counts across all beats (around 10% to 18% of counts) with male officers being the opposite.

Likewise, there did not seem to be major trends for our map showing the average of the average salaries of officers involved in the allegations of each beat.

#### Lessons Learned: 
When all of our previous maps were compared to the average median income of the communities tied to the allegations in each beat, the region of high median income in central Chicago did not match up to the disparities seen in other maps. Assuming that the visualizations reflect reality, we learned from them that there is not an obvious connection between the race, gender, or pay of officers that get allegations in an area and the income of the civilians in the area. However, we have now seen explicitly that the proportions of officer race in allegations vary between areas of Chicago and how they vary.

## 2. Relationship between the race of the complainant and the nature of the complaint.

#### Conclusions: 
We found that for the most part, for each complaint category, approximately half of the complaints were against white officers and about 25% against black and hispanic officers. However, there were a few complaint categories where the ratio of complaints against black officers was almost as much as the ratio of complaints against white officers. For instance, in complaints categorized as Domestic, approximately 43% of the complaints were against white officers and approximately 36% of the complaints were against black officiers. A similar case exists in the category of Conduct Unbecoming (Off-Duty). 

#### Lessons Learned: 
For the most case, the ratio of the number of complaints against an officer is consistent with the distribution of officers in the workforce by race. However, it seems that black officers have almost as many complaints as white officers in Domestic and Conduct Unbecoming (Off-Duty) complaint categories. 

An interesting case is the Domestic violence case. It seems that since in this case complainants are usually family members of the police officers and may therefore be reluctant to issue a complaint, there is the possibility that certain groups of people are not putting in allegations against officers.

## Relationship between the gender, race and salary of the officer and the proportion of complaint sources in the complaints they receive between officers and civilians.

#### Conclusions: 
In general, most officers regardless of gender fell between the 50K to 100K salary bucket, as expected. However, out of all officer races white officers generally had higher salaries, with more officers in the 100K and greater buckets. The proportion of complaint sources that were from officers was significantly less than the proportion of complaint sources from civilians, and this was fairly consistent among all races and genders. 

#### Lessons Learned: 
Since no disparities were apparent in the visualization, it does not seem likely given our dataset that social location is a defining factor for the proportion of officer complainants and civilian complainants. One interesting factor may be looking at the officer complainants themselves to see what types of complaints these officers have against their coworkers and how this compares to the complaint types from civilians.
